  I am a College Junior mainly interested in Cognitive Sciences and Machine Learning Research. I am currently working on a research project based on Pedestrian Crowd Management.
  My interest lies in research in the sphere of Cognitive Sciences. I have always been fascinated by mankind and its wonders and the nature of human knowledge. My alignment towards philosophy, psychology, and cultural history since my childhood days pushed me to work on areas where I can work closely with human brains. As there are diverse methods and outlooks that contribute to the study of mind and intelligence, I gained skills in efficiently writing algorithms that can mimic human nature. I have been working in the area of Deep Learning, AI, Linguistics, and Neuroscience. I wish to opt for Higher Studies in related Graduate Programs to work on some concrete research to feed my curiosity in my areas of interest. One of my major inspirations in the field of Cognitive Sciences is Prof John Vervaeke (Associate Professor at the University of Toronto). Five years from now, I see myself serving on the ideas at the intersection of anthropology and social cognition and publishing impactful independent research work, make a contribution in my field which can change civilization as we know it.
  I am also passionate about Data Science, as Data is the new oil, and I wish to do something incredible with my Data annoation and Data Science skills.
