Jeevanshi is a Masters in Computing Science student at University of Alberta, Canada. She is majorly working around the ideas that intersect Language, Cognition and Machine Intelligence. Before joining as UofA as a graduate student, she was contributing to [Ersilia](https://www.ersilia.io/), as their Outreachy Intern in 2023. She has been a Mitacs Globalink Research Intern in 2020 at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada. Recently, she worked as a Data Science Intern at Emplay, Dublin, CA, contributing to developing keyphrases generation api end-to-end and creating models to detect toxicity in userâ€™s feed for fortune 500 clients. She has been a memeber of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Biomedical and Human Factors Engineering directed by Prof. Yusuf Uzzaman Khan who has also been her thesis-advisor.

She loves to participate in hackathons, perform theatre or learn about Jungâ€™s Ideas on understanding the psyche. Her inspiration to work in the field of Machine Learning came from her immense desire to understand about human brain in a more comprehensive way. Her curosity about the philosiphical and psychological ideas explaining the phenomenons not explained by science, makes me fiddle around the ways that can explain those ideas on empirical data. Apart from it, she loves Music, Mythological Stories, Theatre, and Books.


I am open to collaborated on research projects in the NLP domain. I am especially interested in ambiguity problems in natural language understanding, and common sense reasoning, but I am open to trying new ideas as well.
