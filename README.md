Greetings! I am a senior year Electrical Engineering undergraduate from Zakir Husain College of Engineering and Technology, Aligarh Muslim University, India. At present I am working as a Data Science Intern at Emplay. I was also a Mitacs Globalink Research Intern (2020) at Dalhousie University working under Prof. Darren Abramson. We together worked on the open-end problem of incorporating common sense reasoning in language models, evaluating multiple State-Of-The-Art models in a collection of benchmarks for compositional generalization in language and algorithmic tasks. I contributed predominantly in preparing the data for pre-training on language models and bringing results on benchmark datasets for compositional tasks.

I am interested in research that lies at the intersection of Machine Learning and Cognitive Sciences.

I am open to collaborated on research projects in the NLP domain. I am especially interested in ambiguity problems in natural language understanding, and common sense reasoning, but I am open to trying new ideas as well.

My curosity about the philosiphical and psychological ideas explaining the phenomenons not explained by science, makes me fiddle around the ways that can explain those ideas on empirical data. Apart from it, I love Music, Mythological Stories, Theatre, and Books.
